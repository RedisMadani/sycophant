# Numerous Ninjas - A Thrilling Endless Sidescrolling 2D Mobile Game

## Game Summary

In **Numerous Ninjas**, you'll have the opportunity to customize and control a squad of nimble ninjas capable of rotating and navigating along any axis you desire. Your mission is to conquer a series of chambers while overcoming a myriad of challenging obstacles. Prepare to navigate hot lava, dodge crushing machines, evade projectile-firing weapons, and contend with lasers triggered by your orientation, among many other thrilling challenges.

As you progress, be cautious of the reduced movement speed when in bodies of water. However, leverage the benefits of lowered gravity and the ability to swim upwards. Collect power-ups strategically to aid your ninja squad's advancement through chambers or revive fallen comrades. But beware, some power-ups may hinder your progress, so choose wisely!
